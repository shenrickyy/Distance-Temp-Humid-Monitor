# Distance-Temp-Humid-Monitor
A simple Arduino based project that uses a DHT11 to read temperature and humidity and an ultrasonic sensor for distance. The results are then displayed on a 16x2 LCD and its contrast is controlled with a potentiometer. An active buzzer will alert the user when distance is too close to the sensor or when the temperature exceeds a certain limit.
